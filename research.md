      description: This project aimed to create a computer-readable resources for Serbian from available corpora and dictionaries. Currently, this repository contains structured databases of Serbian synonyms, sense groups, a lemmatized Wikipedia corpus, and several word embedding models generated using these resources. The repository with the description is available <a href='https://github.com/putnich/sr-sh-nlp'>here</a>.

My research interests are mainly related to the applications of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to the grading of short-answers. I am also focused on creating NLP resources for low-resource languages such as Serbian.
